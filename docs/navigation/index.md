The banner of each page links to the [home page](https://d-bl.github.io/),
as does the explicit home link in the various sidebars.
This home page gives a descriptive overview of entry points.

Below a navigation overview with the names of the pages as they appear in the address bar of your browser.
Some pages are prefixed with _d-b.github.io/GroundForge/_, others with just _d-b.github.io/_.
Page _sheet_ is not in the descriptive overview.
It is a page for pricking variations, the generated thread diagrams are supposed to be identical.

The help pages would clutter the overview.
The pages _pattern_, _stitches_ and _droste_ have a button that can hide/show a help menu.
The other pages have a single link or a short story linking to tutorials.
