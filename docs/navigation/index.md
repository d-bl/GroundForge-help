The banner of each page links to the [home page](https://d-bl.github.io/),
like the explicit home link in the various sidebars.
This home page gives a descriptive overview of entry points.
Page _sheet_ is not in the descriptive overview. It is a page for pricking variations, 
see introductions on _tesselace-to-gf_ pages.

Below a navigation overview with the names of the pages as they appear in the address bar of your browser.
Some prefixed with _d-b.github.io/GroundForge_, others with just _d-b.github.io_.
The pages _pattern_, _stitches_ and _droste_ have a button 
that can hide/show a help menu. The help pages would clutter the overview.

Arrow legend  
* blue: download/upload alias import/export  
* black: common routes via links  
* grey: less common routes via links  
* dashed: recovery for obsolete third party links
