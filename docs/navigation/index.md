title: Navigation

The banner of each page links to the [home page](https://d-bl.github.io/),
as does the explicit home link in the various sidebars.
This home page gives a descriptive overview of entry points.

Below a navigation overview with the names of the pages as they appear in the address bar of your browser.
Some pages are prefixed with _d-b.github.io/GroundForge/_, others with just _d-b.github.io/_.
The page _**sheet**_ is not in the descriptive overview.
The page has no controls to manipulate diagrams, other pages provide links for different diagrams.

The pages _**pattern**_, _**stitches**_ and _**droste**_ have a button that can hide/show a help menu.
The other pages have a single link or a short story linking to tutorials.
Both types of help pages would clutter the overview.
The snow mixer (_**mix4snow**_) would also clutter the overview and has a 
[navigation](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge-help/snow-mix/#footside-detour-navigation)
section in its own tutorial.
