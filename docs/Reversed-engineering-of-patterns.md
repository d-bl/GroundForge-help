Working with printed catalogues
=============================

Different methods allow to reproduce a pattern with GroundForge.

- [Recognize patterns](#recognize-patterns)
- [Droste method](#droste-method)

Recognize patterns
------------------

The contents of this section are moved to **Capture patterns**.  

See page [Transformations](/GroundForge-help/transform) for the introduction.

Droste method
-------------

The Droste method uses thread diagrams as pair diagram.

The image below tries to show how to dissect a pair diagram as if it is a thread diagram.
The blue shapes enclose stitches with two pairs alias threads.
The red shapes collect stitches into a repeat with three rows of the diagonal base pattern, its matrix:

    5-
    -5
    5-

The weaving base pattern has always a checkerboard tiling. The diagonal base pattern needs a brick tiling with an odd number of rows and a checkeboard tiling with an even number of rows.
