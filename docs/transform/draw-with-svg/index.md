# Draw your pattern

You can also use a general purpose editor like Adobe-Illustrator, CorelDraw or the free InkScape
and the [SVG version] (right click to download) of the template.

The symbol in each template object has six free snapping points,
two of them should be connected with other objects.
Copy-paste these objects to define a pattern without changing the length or directions of lines connecting the symbols. It might need some out-of-the-box thinking: the Binche snow flake example above has horizontal connections and the vertical connection is reduced to a single stitch. Stretching the stitch into a kind of plait with a hole (`ctcttctc`) reveals traditional connections in the thread diagram.
