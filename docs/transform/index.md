Transformations
===============

Picking a pattern from a [gallery](/) and [changing stitches](/GroundForge-help/index#modify-stitches)
is the easiest way to start experimenting with GroundForge.
Capturing patterns may require some distortions of a traditional technical drawing.
This page illustrates the transformation proces.

An example
----------

![](gms-3086.png?align=left) In [literature](/MAE-gf/docs/literature) or workshops, you may find patterns like
3086 of “Gründe mit System” by Uta Ulrich, similar to [F4](https://www.theedkins.co.uk/jo/lace/whiting/page180.htm)
(though no corner pins are used) in the gallery created from the sampler of mrs Whiting.
See also the  [MAE-gf](/MAE-gf/docs/bias#bias-ground-crossed-rose-style) gallery.

![](plaits.png?align=left) GroundForge does not know how to draw pins, so stitch-pin-stitch becomes a kind of short plait.
Hence, the first transformation step is drawing straight lines from pin to pin.
<p style="clear: both"></p>

![](snap.png?align=left) GroundForge also wants stitches at grid positions. So we move some intersections to the nearest grid position.

![](squeeze.png?align=left) An optional step is to squeeze the pattern to make it more compact.
<p style="clear: both"></p>

![](encoded.png?align=left) Then, we can [encode](/GroundForge-help/Advanced) the pattern in GroundForge and [assign stitches](/GroundForge-help/index#modify-stitches).
For F4 that are cloth stitches and winkie pins. In this case, the winkie pin is: cloth stitch, twist one pair twice around a pin, cloth stitch.
Remember that GroundForge does not draw pins and treats the winkie pin as a single stitch.

![](thread.png?align=left) This thread diagram is the [result], 
please click the wand for the thread diagram after following the link.
<p style="clear: both"></p>

[result]: /GroundForge/stitches?whiting=F4_P180&patchWidth=9&patchHeight=9&d1=ctc&c1=ctc&b1=ctc&a1=ctc&d2=ctc&c2=ctcllctc&a2=ctcrrctc&tile=1483,8-48&footsideStitch=ctctt&tileStitch=ctc&headsideStitch=ctctt&shiftColsSW=-2&shiftRowsSW=2&shiftColsSE=2&shiftRowsSE=2

![img.png?align=left](droste.png?align=left) Another option is to interpret the pair diagram as thread diagram.
A single unit of the ground uses four pairs. So we need only one stitch of four threaads: _clcrct_.
Again: click the wand for the [thread digarm](/GroundForge/droste.html?patchWidth=7&patchHeight=8&footside=----,---b&tile=5-&headside=-,c&shiftColsSW=-1&shiftRowsSW=1&shiftColsSE=1&shiftRowsSE=1&e1=clcrct&l2=ctctt&d2=ctctt&droste2=e15=e16=ctc,e11=ctcllctc,e13=ctcrrctc,l21=llctcll,d22=rrctcrr,d20=d21=d23=d24=l20=l22=l23=l25=ttctctt,).
We call this approach the [droste](/GroundForge-help/Droste-effect) technique.
