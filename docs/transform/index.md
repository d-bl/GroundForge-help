Transformations
===============

Picking a pattern from a [gallery](/) and [changing stitches](/GroundForge-help/index#modify-stitches)
is the easiest way to start experimenting with GroundForge.

Capturing patterns may require some distortions of a traditional technical drawing.
This is a preparation phase. Next phase is the GroundForge definition. The last step is choosing stitches.

* Preparations with a [bias](/GroundForge-help/transform/bias) ground.
* Definition phase with a [rose](/GroundForge-help/Advanced) ground.
* All phases with a [spider](/GroundForge-help/transform/spider).

* [Use SVG to design a pattern](/GroundForge-help/transform/draw-with-svg) 

Note that a bias ground and rose ground are pretty similar in structure.
