# How to transform a spider

## Introduction

![][snab3-00]
So, we have this fancy ground. We wish to define this in GroundForge to play with the stitches.   

This page tells you how you can do this.
<p style="clear: both"></p>

## Step 1

![][snab3-01] 
Start with a pairs-diagram drawing of the ground you wish to use (a "technical" drawing).
<p style="clear: both"></p>

## Step 2

![][snab3-02] 
In the drawing of the ground, replace all

- "stitch-pin-stitch" with "stitch";
- plaits with "stitch";
- tallies with "stitch".

Please note: GroundForge does not support sewings. If your ground has them, please see if they can be replaced with a regular stitch. This includes sew-in beads.

## Step 3

![][snab3-03] 
Straigthen curved lines and put the figure on a square grid.
<p style="clear: both"></p>

## Step 4

![][snab3-04a] 
Adjust pattern:

- make sure all stitches (where two lines connect) are in the middle of a square on the grid;
- use only allowed "connecting" lines (horizontal, vertical down, diagonal down);
- make sure that stitches have two lines comming in and two lines going out.
<p style="clear: both"></p>

![][snab3-04b] 
Allowed connections between the middles:    

In each square there are: 

- 0 incoming and outgoing lines, or
- 1 incoming and 1 outgoing line, or
- 2 incoming and 2 outgoing lines
<p style="clear: both"></p>

Please note:

- There can be other solutions.
- Arrows are not drawn.
- We have put the stitches in the middle of the squares. If it is easier for you to place the stitches on e.g. the upper left corner, that is of course oké.
