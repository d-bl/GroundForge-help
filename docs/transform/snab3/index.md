# Transformation of a spider

## Introduction

![][snab3-00]
So, we have this fancy ground. We wish to define this in GroundForge to play with the stitches.   

This page tells you how you can do this.

## Step 1

![][snab3-01] 
Start with a pairs-diagram drawing of the ground you wish to use (a "technical" drawing).

## Step 2

![][snab3-02]
In the drawing of the ground, replace all

- "stitch-pin-stitch" with "stitch";
- plaits with "stitch";
- tallies with "stitch".

Please note: GroundForge does not support sewings. If your ground has them, please see if they can be replaced with a regular stitch. This includes sew-in beads.
