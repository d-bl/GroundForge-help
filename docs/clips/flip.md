Mirrored and rotated stitches.

Soundless video clip.
---------------------

<video controls style="border: 1px solid; padding-top: 2px;">
    <source src="flip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support an inline <a href="flip">video</a>.

The clip shows that the buttons `↔` and `↕` change the text field.
You can subsequently assign the text value to stitches in the diagram.

patterns (with other stitches than the video demo above) are used to
demonstrate details of the flip effects in the figures below.

A and C are the [color coded](../color-rules.md) diagrams for B and D.
The fat arrow heads indicate working directions.
Each blue dashed line in A-D indicates a flip axis.
A red dashed line in C-D is not a flip axis.
Mixed dashes: flip axis for the pair diagram but not for the thread diagram. 
The small arrow heads in G show that flipping along the red axis can create an
impossible situation because the direction of the worker pair should have flipped too.
The bright green stitch in F show the right part of G in context.
The yellow dashed lines illustrate how the stitches of B rotate by 45 degrees to appear in C.
