Ignore and restore stitches
==========================

Soundless video clip.

<video controls style="border: 1px solid; padding-top: 2px;">
    <source src="ignore.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support an inline <a href="ignore">video</a>.
</video>  

The last step shows that ignoring stitches does not always work:
The algorithm may swap pairs before making a stitch.
Resulting in one column with lines that still cross but no longer have a color coded stitch.
In that case you will have to return to the pattern design.
