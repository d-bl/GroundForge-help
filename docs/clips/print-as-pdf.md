Print with destination PDF
==========================

The soundless video clip shows Firefox, details may vary by browser.

<video controls style="border: 1px solid; padding-top: 2px;">
    <source src="print-as-pdf.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support an inline <a href="print as pdf">video</a>.
</video>  

* The print dialog of your browser has a destination option PDF.
* Your OS may let you browse through thumbnails of saved PDFs.
* Clutter like banners and form fields will usually be removed from the saved document.
* Prepare the desired room for the diagrams, check the preview, perhaps adjust the scale.
* The last seconds of the video clip shows the mouse hovering over a link.
  The status bar at the bottom of the bowser shows the target.
  Once the document is saved, this link goes back to the online page.

**Warning**  
A _thread diagram as pair diagram_ page, may not restore completely.
Open the document in your browser, and you can copy the content of the stitches panel,
provided you made it big enough to show the full content before saving.
Better prepare before saving: follow the link  _pair diagram_ 
on that page follow the link _pair diagram for thread diagram_ 
now it should be safe to save the page.
