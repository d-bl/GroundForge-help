Print with destination PDF
==========================

The soundless video clip shows Firefox, details may vary by browser.

<video controls style="border: 1px solid; padding-top: 2px;">
    <source src="print-as-pdf.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support an inline <a href="print as pdf">video</a>.
</video>  

* The print dialog of your browser has a destination option PDF.
* Your OS may let you browse through thumbnails of saved PDFs.
* Clutter like banners and form fields will be removed from the saved document.
* Prepare the desired room for the diagrams, check the preview, perhaps adjust the scale.
* The last seconds of the video clip shows the mouse hovering over a link.
  The status bar at the bottom of the bowser shows the target.
  Once the document is saved, this link goes back to the online page.
