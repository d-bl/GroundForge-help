The purpose/meaning of buttons/icons in short
=============================================

![ ](/GroundForge/images/wand.png)
**Reload**  
The wand (re)loads a diagram. 
 
The attracting and repelling forces create more or less regularly sized holes in the thread diagram.
It may bridge the difference in shapes of the holes between pattern definition and thread diagram.
For example for [dropped stitches](Replace#drop-stitches) or irregular holes.
An example of the latter is the TesseLace pattern [3x4_447](/GroundForge/stiches.html?TesseLace=3x4_447&patchWidth=12&patchHeight=12&tile=4-L8,-50F,56-O&shiftColsSW=0&shiftRowsSW=3&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=0&)
which becomes surprisingly regular.
See also [reshape patterns](Reshape-Patterns).

![ ](/GroundForge/images/play.png)
**Resume**  
The play button resumes the animation of a diagram. 

The animation may quit too soon, resulting in stretch diagrams 
or even something that looks like throwing a fishing net that dit not yet unfold.
The resume button is there to continue the animation.

![ ](images/toggle-stitch.png) **Stitch**  
The character inside the circle determines the origins 
of the pairs used to make the stitch.
The default [cheat sheet](/GroundForge/images/matrix-template.png) shows all you need to assemble a pattern.
An [extended version](/GroundForge/images/matrix-template-extended.png) 
shows additional symbols used in legacy patterns.
See this half minute [video clip](clips/ignore) for an example of ignoring and restoring stitches.

![2x2](/GroundForge/images/to-color-rules.png) **Color code rules**  
This icon leads to the rules for a color code with up to [four colors per stitch](color-rules).

**Panel size**  
![](images/resize.png?align=right)
Depending on the browser/device, the diagrams may have a hot corner
in the south-east, where the sliders meet as shown on the right.
Drag this corner to adjust the available space. 
The buttons shown here (maximize, default, minimize)are an alternative when the hot corner is not available, for example on touch devices.
A half minute [video clip](clips/resize) shows how to use the set of buttons.


![ ](/GroundForge/images/download.jpg) **[Download](Download)**  
Just one diagram as scalable images for 3rd party [editors](Reshape-Patterns#evaluated-editors),
