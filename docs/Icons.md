The purpose/meaning of buttons/icons in short
=============================================

![ ](/GroundForge/images/wand.png)
**Reload**  
The wand (re)loads a diagram. 
 

![ ](/GroundForge/images/play.png)
**Resume**  
The play button resumes the animation of a diagram.

The animation may quit too soon, resulting in stretch diagrams 
or even something that looks like throwing a fishing net that dit not yet unfold.
The resume button is there to continue the animation.

Pair diagrams in the [stitches](GroundForge/stitches) don't start the animation at all.
Using the resume button may bridge the difference in shapes of the holes between pattern definition and thread diagram.
For example for [dropped stitches](Replace#drop-stitches) or irregular holes.
An example of the latter is the TesseLace pattern [3x4_447](/GroundForge/stitches.html?TesseLace=3x4_447&patchWidth=12&patchHeight=12&tile=4-L8,-50F,56-O&shiftColsSW=0&shiftRowsSW=3&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=0&)
which becomes surprisingly regular.
See also [reshape patterns](Reshape-Patterns).
The wand will reload the initial shape.

**Panel size**  
The buttons maximize, default, minimize can be convinient on desktops/laptops
but are essential on touch devices.

![](images/resize.png?align=right)
Depending on the browser/device, the diagrams may have a hot corner
in the south-east, where the sliders meet as shown on the right.
Drag this corner to adjust the available space. 
The buttons shown here (maximize, default, minimize)are an alternative when the hot corner is not available, for example on touch devices.
A half minute [video clip](clips/resize) shows how to use the set of buttons.
