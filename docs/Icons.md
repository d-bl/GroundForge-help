The purpose/meaning of buttons/icons in short
=============================================

![(i)](/GroundForge/images/information-icon.png) **Link**  
To a help page. Hover over the icon for the subject.

![wand](/GroundForge/images/wand.png)
![link](/GroundForge/images/link.png)
**[Reload](Undo)**  
The wand reloads only the diagrams (faster) / 
the link reloads the entire page and your browser will remember the pattern

![](images/toggle-stitch.png) **Stitch**  
The character inside the circle determines the origins 
of the pairs used to make the stitch.
The default [cheat sheet](/GroundForge/images/matrix-template.png) shows all you need to assemble a pattern.
An [extended version](/GroundForge/images/matrix-template-extended.png) 
shows additional symbols used in legacy patterns.

![3x3](/GroundForge/images/swatches.png) **Stitch enumeration**  
This icon lets you toggle between showing/hiding an enumeration of used stitches and their color(s).
The button is only available on the crowded deprecated page.

![2x2](/GroundForge/images/to-color-rules.png) **Color code rules**  
This icon leads to the rules for a color code with up to [four colors per stitch](color-rules).  
The Droste pair diagrams still use a [single color per stitch](Color-Code).

![print](/GroundForge/images/print.png) **Print/PDF friendly**
The [page](print-pdf) is intended to build your own catalogue of patterns,
either on paper or as a collection of PDF documents.

![inc](/GroundForge/images/size-inc.jpg)
![dec](/GroundForge/images/size-dec.jpg) -
![max](/GroundForge/images/maximize.jpg)
![reset](/GroundForge/images/reset-dimensions.jpg)
![min](/GroundForge/images/minimize.jpg)
**Panel size**  
Depending on the browser/device, the diagrams may have a hot corner
in the south-east, where the sliders meet.
Drag this corner to adjust the available space. 
The buttons shown here are an alternative when the hot corner is not available, for example on touch devices.
A half minute [video](clips/resize) clip shows how to use the second set of buttons.

![ ](/GroundForge/images/animate.png) **Animate**  
It may bridge the difference in shapes of the holes between pattern definition and thread diagram. 
For example for [dropped stitches](Replace#drop-stitches) or irregular holes. 
An example of the latter is the TesseLace pattern [3x4_447](/GroundForge/tiles.html?TesseLace=3x4_447&patchWidth=12&patchHeight=12&tile=4-L8,-50F,56-O&shiftColsSW=0&shiftRowsSW=3&shiftColsSE=4&shiftRowsSE=0&)
which becomes surprisingly regular.
See also [reshape patterns](Reshape-Patterns).

![ ](/GroundForge/images/download.jpg) **[Download](Download)**  
Scalable images for 3rd party [editors](Reshape-Patterns#evaluated-editors),
or templates for an [Inkscape plugin](/inkscape-bobbinlace/).
