Example from Binche Kompakt
===========================
 
_Binche Kompakt_ is a sampler designed by Hildegund Jene
 which features 32 different grounds drawn from Flemish, Parisian,and Valenciennes laces.
The pattern is no longer available at the [Deutscher Klöppelverband], but you may find it in the second-hand market.
 Ground number 31 in the sampler is particularly challenging to work because it uses a combination of half-stitch (CT) and whole-stitch (CTCT) in the ring pairs.
 To better understand this ground, a GroundForge model was made.

Since this lace ground has been captured in GroundForge, it is relatively straight forward to play with different snowflake variations. 
We invite you to experiment using the GroundForge base pattern [with] or [without] foot sides.  
Click on a stitch in the pair diagram to apply the stitch specified in the textfield just above the diagram.
This text field can have any combination of 'c', 't', 'r' or 'l' or just a '-' to drop a stitch.  
For more detailed instructions on editing the stitches, please refer to the [Help page](Replace). 

Below are four main variations showing the pattern diagram (top row) and corresponding thread diagram (bottom row).

The extensive catalogue _Viele gute Gründe_ by Ulricke Voelcker-Löhr contains many snowflake variations.  Several of these are similar to the four variations presented here:
* In 7 snowflakes (B3.25, B3.71-B3.76), two diagonal pairs cross twice, as in the first variation above.
* In 28 snowflakes (B3.5, B3.6, B3.17-B3.23, B3.26-B3.36, B3.93, B3.103, B3.132, B3.139, B3.140), diagonal pairs cross just once as in the second variation above.
* There are 3 variations (B3.106-B3.108) that do not enclose the top and bottom pin like the third variation,
* and 3 with a hole in the center of the snowflake (B3.12-B3.14) like the fourth variation. 
 
 This gives 41 snowflake-variations that can be easily modeled in GroundForge. We can multiply this by the 22 variations of B4 (stitch variations for ring pairs that surround a six-pair element) to give 902 stitch-variations of the basic pattern documented in VGG.  Using slightly unorthodox methods, such as twisting only the left or only the right pair (only B3.33 and B3.106 of VGG use these kinds of stitches) or allowing more than three cross/twist combinations at each intersection, results in thousands of variations.

#### Advanced pattern editing

Dropping stitches using '-' can have unexpected results such as disappearing or reversed stitches. 
A safer alternative is to modify the pattern to remove the stitch circles.
For that purpose you have to follow the link to the _pattern definition_.
In the following diagram, the blue edits remove the middle stitch for variation 2.
The red edits remove the top and bottom stitches for variation 3.
For variation 4 you can choose to remove the middle stitch and add twists to the adjacent cloth stitches,
or apply just a twist to the middle stitch.

### History of Ground 31

In issue 2000/2 of the Belgian lace magazine [_Kant_](https://www.kantcentrum.eu/en/magazine), Anne-Marie Verbeke-Billiet published a handkerchief pattern called _Anneke_ based on an old Valenciennes example.  She included four variations of stitches traditionally used in Paris ground and in the ring pairs around snowflakes.  The variation that is most unusual uses a combination of whole (CTCT) and half (CT) stitches.  This stitch combination, which she labels TT4 in the article (see also B4.2 in _Viele gute Gründe_ by Ulricke Voelcker-Löhr), has the effect of blurring the ring pairs around the snowflakes until they almost disappear.  According to Verbeke-Billiet, this stitch combination was once as popular as the whole stitch variation (TT1 in Kant and B4.1 in VGG) that is so familiar today. TT4 fell out of the lacemaker's repertoire about one hundred years ago perhaps because, like many half-stitch grounds, it is very difficult to work. The threads don't travel in tidy vertical and diagonal lines making it hard, especially when worked without pins, to keep track of where you are in the pattern.
 
In 2004, Hildegund Jene published a sampler called _Binche Kompakt_ which featured 32 different grounds drawn from Flemish, Parisian,and Valenciennes laces.  Ground number 31 is the challenging TT4 ground described by Verbeke-Billiet.  When Jo Pol started to work on Binche Kompakt, she could find neither a thread diagram, nor a high resolution photo of a sample of TT4.  She decided to create a thread diagram using GroundForge.  This exercise motivated Pol to include several of the features you find in GroundForge today.
