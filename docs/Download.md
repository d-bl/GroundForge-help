may apply to:
* a diagram as scalable vector image from
* a template for an [Inkscape plugin](/inkscape-bobbinlace/)
  (on the "pattern definition" panel on the all-in-one page) 
  
Templates
---------

The download may also appear as button in a phrase.

A template is a text file, please preview before trying to apply:
it might contain an error message.

The plugin renders regular or circular patterns from the download file.
These templates are not available on iOS nor Android (read: tablets, smartphones),
Inkscape does not run on these systems.

Diagrams
--------
The download icon for diagrams launches a download dialog on a mouse click,
when tapping on a tablet or smartphone, you get a link that opens the dialog.

On desk/lap-tops you can view a download in a browser
by dragging it with your mouse between the tabs:  
![](images/download.png)

Some browsers may have a limit on the size of the downloads. 

Some tablets open a download in a browser, some of those fail to render. 
Other save a download in a photo section, 
but it is a vector based image, not a pixel based photo.
A 3rd party [editor](Reshape-Patterns#evaluated-editors)
supporting SVG can show and change the download.
It may need to get access to the photos section or wherever the download is stored.

A use case to edit thread diagrams:
apply other [colors/widths](Thread-Properties#more-thread-colors-andor-widths) 
to the threads.
