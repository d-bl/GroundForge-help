The download icon ![](/GroundForge/images/download.jpg) 
downloads:
* templates for an [Inkscape plugin](/inkscape-bobbinlace/)
  from the "pattern definition" panel
* the diagram as scalable image from the other panels
  
Templates
---------
A template is a text file, please preview before trying to apply:
it might contain an error message.
The plugin renders regular or circular patterns from the download file.
These templates are not available on iOS nor Android (read: tablets, smartphones),
Inkscape itself does not run on these systems.

Diagrams
--------
The download icon for diagrams launches a download dialog on a mouse click,
when tapping, you get a link that opens the dialog.
You can view a download in a browser by dragging it with your mouse between the tabs:

Some bowsers may have a limit on the size of the downloads. 

Some tablets open a download in a browser, some of those fail to render. 
Other save a download in a photo section, 
but it is a vector based image, not a pixel based photo.
A 3rd party [editor](Reshape-Patterns#evaluated-editors)
supporting SVG can show and change the download.
It may need to get access to the photos section or wherever the download is stored.

A use case to edit thread diagrams:
apply other [colors/widths](Thread-Properties#more-thread-colors-andor-widths) 
to the threads.
