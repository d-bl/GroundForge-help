Tutorial for the Nets Page
===========

The [nets] page is a playground for (unorthodox) stitches.
The stitches are applied on the nets shown below.
Playing around can give you a first impression of the power of GroundForge.

[nets]: /GroundForge/nets

Introduction
------------

The page has two sections: stitches and diagrams. 

The stitches section has
* a gallery with some arbitrary examples of stitches
* an input box where you can define a stitch from scratch or modify a stitch selected from the gallery
* flip buttons to mirror the stitch in the input box
* a table with mirrored versions of a stitch
* a wand that updates the table and clears the diagrams

The wands in the diagrams section generate the thread diagrams.
Highlighting stitches can help to recognize the stitches in the diagrams.
The colours have no other meaning than to match the stitches 
in the thread diagrams with their positions in the pair diagrams.

The thread diagrams use one, two or four of the mirrored stitches shown in the table. 
With asymmetrical stitches you get more diagrams.

The captions in the stitch gallery are links that put a definition in the input box where you can adjust it.

You can argue that the last stitches in the gallery are multiple stitches. 
GroundForge does not know how threads react to pins so everything with just two pairs is a single stitch.
Anyway, these stitches are too large for the small space per diagram.

Symmetry introduction
---------------------

This page was born out of curiosity about the effects of symmetry.
Investigation of the theory after experimenting caused a mathematical a headache:
we applied flipping for diagonal grounds on square grounds.
However, it is not necessary to understand the math or apply it correctly
to discover interesting grounds with the [nets] page.
The theory is explained on the [flip](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge-help/clips/flip).
page. 


Tweak patterns
--------------

The diagram links lead to pages where you can tweak the results.
The linked page starts with a button that can reveal help links.

First steps:
* Apply colour to the threads to reveal how they flow through the net.
* Adjust how pairs enter and leave the foot side.

The page has a similar gallery of stitches (and iput box with flip buttons) as on the nets page.
The difference is a [color code](color-rules) that supports unorthodox stitches.
The pair diagram next to the thread diagrams uses the same color code.
You may see cross marks in the pair diagram to indicate twists.
Hover with the cursor over the stitches to see which one has the leading or trailing twists. 
This way you can learn how define the desired stitch in the input box.
The click the stitch in the pair diagram to replace it.

DIY patterns
------------

The diagrams generated on the nets page only scratch the surface of possible stitch combinations
After some experience with tweaking patterns, you can start to create
your own patterns with other combinations of (unrelated) stitches.

Hints for the nets page
-----------------------

Changing the input box manually and using the _tab_ on your keyboard (or click anywhere on the page) 
has the same effect as the wand in the stitches section.
After selecting a stitch from the gallery, you do need the wand to update the tabel with stitches.

You can use the print button of your browser and choose destination PDF to save your diagrams.
Copy-paste content of the input box in the stitches section to reproduce the page online.
