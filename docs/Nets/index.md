Tutorial for the Nets Page
===========

The [nets] page is a playground for (unorthodox) stitches.
The stitches are applied on simple diagonal and horizontal nets.
Playing around can give you a first impression of the power of GroundForge.
You will have to decide for yourself where and how to place pins.

[nets]: /GroundForge/nets

Introduction
------------

The page has two sections: stitches and diagrams. 

The stitches section has:
* An input box where you can define a stitch from scratch or modify a stitch selected from the gallery.
* A gallery with twelve arbitrary examples of stitches.
  Scroll when you see less. The links put the stitch in the input box.
* Flip buttons to mirror the stitch in the input box.
* A table with mirrored versions of the stitch in the input box.
* A wand that updates the table and clears the diagrams.

The wands in the diagrams section generate the thread diagrams.
It may take some seconds until something happens. Please wait.
The diagrams are divided into groups, generating all at once could choke your browser.
Please wait for the animation to complete before clicking another wand.

Highlighting stitches can help to recognize the stitches in the diagrams.
The colours have no other meaning than to match the stitches 
in the thread diagrams with their positions in the pair diagrams.

The thread diagrams use one, two or four of the mirrored stitches shown in the table. 
With asymmetrical stitches you get more diagrams.

You can argue that the last stitches in the gallery are multiple stitches. 
GroundForge does not know how threads react to pins so everything with just two pairs is a single stitch.
Anyway, these stitches are too large for the small space per diagram.

Symmetry introduction
---------------------

It is not necessary to understand the theory of symmetry to discover interesting [nets].
However, the theory can help you to understand the results.

This page was born out of curiosity about the effects of symmetry.
The experiments caused a surprise: flipping on diagonal nets works as the buttons suggest.
On horizontal nets, a flipped stitch should be applied on a row with another working direction.
The details are explained on the [flip](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge-help/clips/flip#symmetry)
page.


Customize patterns
------------------

The links in the diagram captions lead to pages where you can customize the results.
The linked page:
* Is called _stitches_ in the page address and _stitches and threads_ in the subtitle.
* Starts with a button that can reveal help links.
* Has a similar gallery of stitches (and an input box with flip buttons) as the _nets_ page.
  The difference is a [color code](color-rules) for each stitch that supports unorthodox stitches.
  The pair diagram next to the thread diagrams uses the same color code.

First steps:
* Highlight threads to reveal how they flow through the net.
* Play with the cloth stitch in the center of diagonal repeats.
* Adjust the number of accumulated twists.
* Adjust the number of twists for pairs entering and leaving the foot side.

You may see cross marks in the pair diagram to indicate twists between stitches.
Hover with the cursor over the adjacent stitches to see which one is responsible for those twists. 
This way you can learn how to change which stitches.
Put the desired value in the input box and click the stitch in the pair diagram to replace it.


DIY patterns
------------

The diagrams generated on the nets page only scratch the surface of possible stitch combinations.
Other options are odd numbers of two stitches out of the four mirrored stitches,
or combinations with three of the four stitches. 

With some experience in customizing patterns, it becomes easier to create
your own patterns with not provided combinations of stitches or even unrelated stitches.
The page [embelished clothwork](https://d-bl.github.io/MAE-gf/docs/ec)
provides starting points for horizontal nets with other dimensions than two by two stitches.  
An [e-book](https://www.patreon.com/theadventurouslacemakers/shop/embellished-clothwork-ebook-by-marian-221058?source=storefront)
with the same name applies the horizontal nets in motives.

See also [MAE-nets](https://d-bl.github.io/MAE-gf/docs/nets) for other types of nets.


Hints for the nets page
-----------------------

Changing the input box manually and using the _tab_ on your keyboard (or click anywhere on the page) 
has the same effect as the wand in the stitches section.

Typing enter reloads the page, the input box of the stitches section becomes part of the page address.
If the highlight check box was ticked, you will have to tick it again. 
You also may have to regenerate diagrams with a wand.

You can use the print button of your browser and choose destination PDF to save your diagrams as far as generated.
Copy-paste content of the input box in the stitches section of the document to reproduce the page online.
